Question 1:
A coin is thrown in which the probability of getting a head is 1/3. What is the expected number of throws needed to get two consecutive heads.
  x = HH + HT + T
  x = (1/3 * 1/3 * 2) + (1/3 * 2/3 * (x+2)) + (2/3 * (x+1)) 
  x = 12

Question 2:
What is the no of throws needed to get all 6 faces of a 6 side die.
  x = 6(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6)
  x = 14.7 -> 15

Question 3:
What is the expected number of throws needed to get 4 consecutive tails when a fair coin is tossed.
  x = pow(2, n+1) - 2
  x = 30

Question 4:
What is the expected number of coin flips to ensure that there are atleast N heads?
  P(H) = 1/2
  N = 2
  2N
